## COD Zombies is on life support so I made it myself

A big portion of Apothicon, specifically the 
- rendering logic
- A* implementation
- player/zombie collision

were made trivial thanks to [RyiSnow's 2D Java Game series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq). Great guide for anyone wanting to get into this sort of thing

Assets are original, some designs/sounds are not (perks + gun sounds)
