# Apothicon
### [Map Converter](https://github.com/erictatchell/apothicon-map-builder)

## COD Zombies is on life support so I made it myself

A big portion of Apothicon, specifically the 
- rendering logic
- A* implementation
- collision

is made easily thanks to [RyiSnow's 2D Java Game series on YouTube]([https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq))
